# Power BI dashboard (including 5 sub-dashboards)

An interactive **Power BI report** visualizing key insights from real smart home data with solar panels.  
The dashboard highlights how environmental and household factors influence solar energy production and self-sufficiency.

## ☀️ Main Dashboard
The **main page** provides an overview of:
- Solar energy generation by **daylight hours**, **sunshine duration**, and **weather type**  
- **Energy flow** within the house (solar → battery → grid → consumption)  
- **Import days**, showing when grid energy was needed  

## 📊 Sub-Dashboards
The report includes **five detailed sub-dashboards** focusing on:
1. Effect of sunlight and temperature on solar output
2. Effect of weather conditinos on solar output
3. Import + export of energy 
4. Import days  
5. Self-Sufficiency – how independent the home is from the external grid

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Power BI Desktop (2025)**  
- **Data Sources:** Smart home sensor data, solar inverter logs, and weather data (Open-Meteo API)  
- **Modeling:** DAX measures, calculated KPIs, and relationships between energy, weather, and time dimensions  

## 📈 Purpose
This dashboard supports the analysis of a real household’s solar energy system and helps identify optimization opportunities to **reduce imports** and **increase self-sufficiency**.
